# Programming_Things_Assignment1


Intro
This is an repo of my assignment for programming things, where we coded pololu zumo 32u4 robot to perform tasks given to us in assignment breif. The purpose of this assignment was to simulate a "search and rescue", where the zumo robot is required to navigate through corridoor and keep within lines.

In order to achive this task, different libaries and aspects were used to complete these. For example the line sensors to keep within the corridoors and rooms, the wireless serial communications between xBee and GUI, as well as using the motors to move the zumo.
